{
  "name": "User Datagram Protocol",
  "shortName": "UDP",
  "summary": "A connectionless transport protocol in the Internet protocol suite that allows applications to send messages without establishing a prior connection. Provides minimal transport service with no guarantees of delivery, order, or duplicate protection.",
  "layer": "TCP/IP",
  "ports": [],
  "rfcs": ["RFC 768"],

  "purpose": "Provide a simple, low-overhead, connectionless method for sending messages between applications on a network",

  "handshake": {
    "description": "UDP is connectionless and does not perform a handshake. Data is sent directly from sender to receiver without establishing a session.",
    "steps": []
  },

  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "Source Port",
      "type": "16-bit field",
      "description": "Port of the sender (optional; can be 0)"
    },
    {
      "name": "Destination Port",
      "type": "16-bit field",
      "description": "Port of the receiver"
    },
    {
      "name": "Length",
      "type": "16-bit field",
      "description": "Specifies the length of the UDP header and payload in bytes"
    },
    {
      "name": "Checksum",
      "type": "16-bit field",
      "description": "Used for error-checking of the header and payload (optional in IPv4, mandatory in IPv6)"
    }
  ],

  "message": {
    "unit": "Datagram",
    "structure": {
      "header": "Source Port, Destination Port, Length, Checksum",
      "payload": "UDP payload (data carried by UDP)"
    }
  },

  "usage": [
    "Applications that require low latency and can tolerate packet loss, such as DNS queries, VoIP, video streaming, and online gaming"
  ],

  "pitfalls": [
    "No delivery guarantee: packets can be lost or duplicated",
    "No ordering: messages may arrive out of sequence",
    "No built-in congestion control or flow control",
    "No encryption or authentication by default"
  ]
