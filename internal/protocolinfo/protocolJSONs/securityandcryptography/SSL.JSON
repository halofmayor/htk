  "summary": "A cryptographic protocol for securing network communication, predecessor of TLS. SSL provides encryption, integrity, and authentication but is now considered deprecated in favor of TLS.",
  "layer": "Application (runs over TCP)",
  "ports": [],
  "rfcs": ["RFC 6101 (SSL 3.0)"],

  "purpose": "Secure data transmission over networks, providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication",

  "handshake": {
    "description": "SSL handshake is similar to TLS, involving version negotiation, key exchange, and authentication.",
    "steps": [
      "Step 1: ClientHello – client proposes SSL version, cipher suites, and sends random number.",
      "Step 2: ServerHello – server selects version, cipher suite, and sends certificate.",
      "Step 3: Key Exchange – client and server exchange keying material.",
      "Step 4: Finished – handshake completion and secure session established."
